# About me

Hi, I'm Erik! I have a social science background and hold a BSc econ in Criminology and Sociology alongside a MSc in Social Science Research Methods from Cardiff University. I also recently successfully defended my PhD thesis at Cardiff University. I have experience in descriptive statistics, bivariate analysis, hypothesis testing, exploratory data analysis, inferential statistics, data cleaning, data collection, and data visualization. I am skilled with the programming language R for data analysis (my preferred tool of choice) and have experience with spreadsheets and SQL. After doing some freelance data analysis work I realised I held a passion for helping people and businesses navigate the world of data. Consequently, I decided to veer away from a academic career path for the time being. I then successfully obtained a Google Data Analytics Certificate which gave me a understanding of how data analysis and statisticals are used to solve business problems. I enjoy applying my skills to both business and research oriented problems.

This is a repository to showcase my data analyst/data science skills through sharing and discussing examples of my work or projects.

# Data Projects

Personal data projects conducted on publically available datasets.

## Store Analysis

**Analysis:** [Store Analysis](https://github.com/etceek/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/store_analysis.md)<br/> 
(The style of this presented analysis represents what would be sent to a stakeholder or client and not someone with data analysis or coding expertise, hence, it does not show my actual coding)<br/> 
**Description:** The dataset contains information on a store's sales, products, and customer segments over several years. In total, the data contains 9994 observations spread across 21 variables. The project involves the following steps: mild data cleaning and preprocessing, EDA (exploratory data analysis) which includes univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis, analysing how sales and profit differ across customer segments, product types, location, and more.<br/> 
**Skills:** data analysis, descriptive statistics, data visualisation, data cleaning.<br/>
**Technology:** R, RStudio, Rmarkdown, Tidyverse, ggplot2.<br/>
**Results:** Overview of the store's business, shows how sales and profit vary across key characteristics, data-business recommendation regarding raising profit.<br/>

## Video Game Sales Analysis

**Analysis:** [Videogame Sales Analysis](https://github.com/etceek/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/vg_sales_analysis.md)<br/> 
(The style of this presented analysis includes my code)<br/>
**Description:** The dataset analysed contains information on video game sales between 1980 and 2016. In total, the dataset contains 16598 observations across 11 variables. Specifically, it offers data on videogame name, publisher, genre, console released on, year released, and sales. The project involves the following steps: data cleaning and preprocessing, transformation of data into new variables, EDA (exploratory data analysis) which includes univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis.<br/> 
**Skills:** data analysis, descriptive statistics, data visualisation, data cleaning.<br/>
**Technology:** R, RStudio, Rmarkdown, Tidyverse, ggplot2.<br/>
**Results:** Analysis and visualisations to descriptive show how sales vary across genre, console, publisher, and region.<br/>

# Academic Work

My thesis "How does legalising cannabis influence the purchasing choices of cannabis consumers and the modus operandi of illicit cannabis suppliers?" required me to conduct several data analysis tasks. Here I summarise these data tasks which showcase my quantitative data analysis skills and experience. 

(I am awaiting for my thesis re-submission (with corrections done) to be accepted, once this is done and my thesis is published I will provide a link to it here).

## Descriptive Statistics

**Description:** This chapter contains descriptive statistics on a dataset containing illicit cannabis price data between 2005 to early 2020 for the United States. A necessary pre-prerequisite for this analysis involved collecting and cleaning the price data. The data was analysed across time, by geography (i.e., by state), cannabis regulation, and proximity to legalised states. Data analysis involved summary statistics and visualisations.<br/> 
**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, descriptive statistics, data visualisation, data collection, data cleaning.<br/>
**Technology:** R, RStudio, Tidyverse, ggplot2.<br/>
**Results:** A descriptive overview of illicit cannabis price data for the United States.<br/>

## Multiple Linear Regression

**Description:** For my thesis I constructed a multiple linear regression model that estimated the association between operational Coloradoan retail cannabis store licenses and illicit cannabis prices in neighbouring states, while controlling for other potential confounder influences. This analysis required the collection of data from several secondary data sources. Such data covered Coloradoan store licenses, law enforcement arrest rates, medical cannabis regulation laws (which were coded into categories), distance between cities, household county income, and population sizes. Bivariate analysis and hypothesis testing was used to identify which variables or confounder influences to include in the multiple linear regression model.<br/>
**Skills:** data collection, dataset creation, data cleaning, bivariate statistics, hypothesis testing, multiple linear regression, model assumption checking, feature/variable selection.<br/>
**Technology:** R, RStudio, Tidyverse, ggplot2.<br/>
**Results:** A formal estimation of a negative association between Colorodoan retail store licenses and illicit cannabis prices in neighbouring states which accounted for  other potential confounder influences.<br/>

## Interrupted Time Series Analysis

**Description:** For my thesis I also constructed an interrupted time series model using segmented regression which contrasted illicit cannabis prices before and after legal sale started. This model estimated the initial level change in price (commencing from Colorado first implementing legal sale) and the subsequent trend change per month. Model assumptions were also checked and seasonality controlled for.<br/> 
**Skills:** data collection, data cleaning, interrupted time series, segmented regression, model assumption checking.<br/>
**Technology:** R, RStudio.<br/>
**Results:** An estimated negative association between Colorado's legal sale implementation date and illicit cannabis prices in neigbhouring states.<br/>

# Work Experience

Where I can (with permission) I discuss the data analysis work I've done for clients (note due to client confidentiality I can not directly show any analysis as I can with my own persoal data projects or PhD thesis).

## Creativity Survey Analysis

**Description:** I was commissioned by MAMA Marketing LTD to be the lead data analyst on a quantitative survey study which the SW&T (Somerset West and Taunton) Council and CICCIC (Creative Innovation Centre CIC) funded. The survey focused on young people (aged between 14-24) in the SW&T area. The survey contained 19 questions from 702 submissions (after cleaning, these submissions lowered to 646). Specifically, the study had three overarching research questions regarding current levels of creativity and provision, the demand and opportunity for improved creative programmes, and attitudes towards creativity becoming a career. I cleaned, analysed, and visualised the data from the survey answers for the stakeholders.<br/>
**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, descriptive statistics, bivariate analysis, visualisation, report writing.<br/>
**Technology:** R, Rstudio, Microsoft Excel.<br/>
**Results:** Analysis and visualisation of survey responses that helped answer the research questions of the study.<br/>
